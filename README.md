# Leveraging machine learning to drive business impact for Airbnb’s biggest competitor: VRBO
## Focus: Precision Pricing with Machine Learning; Maximizing Property Potential through Sentiment Analysis

### Executive Summary
Operating successfully in the online short-term rental industry involves providing a pleasant experience to both, the users looking to book properties and the property owners renting their resources. To augment the given use case in hand, we undertook the project to solve it in two halves. 

Firstly, we gathered data from VRBO.com, one of Airbnb's largest competitors, to identify various attributes that determine the pricing for properties in well-known US cities like San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and many more. This part of the project is where we identify, gather, and prepare the data required for our analysis. 
Then, we will detail the second task, where we utilize the collected data to further perform two essential sub-tasks using machine learning algorithms. The first sub-task is to develop algorithms that will analyze the pricing trends on VRBO.com¹, and then use the models to predict rental property prices based on the factors that will best describe a relationship with ‘price’. The second sub-task is to use the algorithms to offer customer-centric recommendations to property owners based on the reviews on their property, enabling them to improve their property listings for better profitability and increased booking chances. In this report, we will delve into our discoveries from machine learning model results to guide business owners in this industry. Our goal through this project is to enhance user experience, increase engagement, and supplement usage of short-term rentals like VRBO, among customers by providing fairly determined prices and promoting a more transparent listing that can ultimately create business value. The insights obtained from this project will be useful for home rental business owners, allowing them to make well-informed decisions about prices and amenities that can optimize their properties for the market. Furthermore, since the project concentrates on popular tourist destinations in the US, it is particularly relevant to the hospitality sector, providing stakeholders with valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences. Overall, this
project has the potential to contribute to the growth and evolution of the short-term rental market, while also providing significant value to users and industry stakeholders.

### Introduction of the Domain
The vacation rental industry is expanding rapidly and has the potential for significant innovation and disruption. The emergence of platforms like Airbnb and VRBO has transformed the way people travel and find accommodations, making it more convenient and economical for travelers to find comfortable
and affordable lodging while also providing property owners with new avenues to generate revenue. According to Allied² market research, the global vacation rental market size reached $91.2 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow to $315 billion by 2031. Additionally, Statistica² reports that there were over
1,000 distinct properties available in San Francisco alone in April 2022, indicating a potential user base of over 62.99 million by 2027.
Despite this growth, the industry faces several challenges such as fluctuating demand, varying pricing strategies, and the need to provide personalized experiences for customers. By leveraging data and employing machine learning techniques, we can assist
property owners in optimizing their rental properties for the market and improving the rental experience for tenants. The insights gleaned from this project can aid industry stakeholders in better understanding consumer behavior and preferences, resulting in more efficient and effective rental markets. Therefore,
this field offers an exciting and challenging opportunity for data-driven innovation and value creation.

### How does the industry tackle the mentioned problems traditionally?
Per our knowledge of this domain, to tackle the two business problems at hand, here is how traditionally,
the rental industry handled them:
- Price prediction: Property owners and rental managers traditionally use their own experience and market knowledge to set prices for their properties. They would often rely on competitive analysis, comparing their prices to other similar properties in the same area. However, this method was not always accurate
and could lead to overpricing or underpricing of properties. In recent years, there has been increasing use of data analysis tools and software to help property managers set prices based on real-time market data and demand trends. Therefore, with our machine learning models, we will be able to exactly identify the
essential and contributing factors to determine the price for a property, thereby helping the owners set a strategically transparent and analytically driven price for their property

- Customer reviews: Traditionally, property owners relied on their experience and intuition to improve their properties based on customer feedback. However, with the growth of online booking platforms, customer reviews have become more important than ever in improving property listings, therefore it is crucial to
consider and carefully analyze these reviews to understand the ongoing sentiments. Many rental businesses now actively encourage customers to leave reviews and ratings, which are displayed prominently on their online listings. Not only it is helpful for property owners in the way that they can use
this feedback to make targeted improvements and adjustments to their properties but these reviews also help advertise the credibility of a property to other prospective customers. Because of this growing focus on customer reviews, the owners should use an automated sentiment analysis tool to help them identify
common themes and issues across customer reviews, allowing them to improve their listing
